# Vue.js Portfolio Website with Auto-Typing Effect and Floating Image Animation

This Vue.js portfolio website showcases a creative and dynamic way to present personal information, skills, projects, and contact details. It features an auto-typing effect for the user's roles and a floating image animation that adds a touch of interactivity to the hero section.

## Key Features

- **Auto-Typing Effect:** The user's roles are displayed with a typewriter-like effect, adding a dynamic element to the introduction.

- **Floating Image Animation:** The hero image floats up and down, creating a subtle yet engaging visual effect.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Auto-Typing Effect

The auto-typing effect is achieved using JavaScript's `setInterval()` and `setTimeout()` functions. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```javascript
// Array of roles
const roles = ["UI/UX Designer", "Web Developer", "Graphic Designer", "Frontend Developer", "Gamer"];

// Current role index
let roleIndex = 0;

// Typing speed (adjust as needed)
const typingSpeed = 100;

// Function to type the role
typeRole() {
  const roleInterval = setInterval(() => {
    this.currentRole += this.roles[this.roleIndex][this.currentRole.length];
    if (this.currentRole === this.roles[this.roleIndex]) {
      clearInterval(roleInterval);
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.eraseRole();
      }, 1000); // Wait for 1 second before erasing
    }
  }, this.typingSpeed);
}
```

- The `roles` array contains the different roles the user wants to display.

- The `roleIndex` variable keeps track of the current role being displayed.

- The `typingSpeed` variable controls the speed at which the characters are typed.

- The `typeRole()` function is called to start the auto-typing effect. It uses `setInterval()` to add characters to the `currentRole` string one by one, simulating the typing effect.

- Once the entire role is typed, a `setTimeout()` function is used to wait for 1 second before calling the `eraseRole()` function, which removes the characters one by one, creating the effect of erasing
